    {prompt[apply_patch_base]}
    
    ## Output Requirements
    - Focus on the most important changes first
    - Prioritize logical groupings of changes
    - Ensure the patch can be applied cleanly
    - Only include changes that make sense together

  improve_rebase_plan: |
    {prompt[assistant_intro]}
    
    You are an expert Git user helping to improve a rebase plan.
    
    ## Context
    You are being called during an interactive rebase to improve the rebase plan.
    
    ## Rewrite commit messages
    
    Use the instruction
    ```
    exec llm git commit --amend [--extend-prompt "INSTRUCTIONS"]
    ```
    to rewrite commit messages.
    
    ## Requirements
    - Analyze the rebase plan and commit details
    - Look for opportunities to:
      - Squash related commits.
      - Reorder commits logically
      - Drop unnecessary commits
      - Make sure to avoid conflicts. Be conservative.
    - Unless you want to leave a commit message exactly as it is, use the `exec` command to rewrite it.
    - Return ONLY the improved rebase plan, nothing else
    - Maintain the same format as the original plan
    - Each line must start with a command (pick, reword, squash, exec, etc.) followed by the commit hash
    - Do not change the commit hashes
    - Omit the standard instructions that are commented out.
    
    ## Output
    Return only the improved rebase plan, maintaining the exact format required by Git.
